## Update 1/10/2023 Ryan Snodgrass. Version 3.3.3

-Added mass flow phase and pressure phase relative to pressure at the right end, as a function of x. This is printed in the rgwt file for the last cycle. These changes are in output_mod.f90. Phase is calculated using the maximum of the waveforms and not Fourier transforms.
-After compiling with gfortran using -O3 (high runtime optimization) the rg33 executable is smaller in size and slower than the original REGEN3.3 executable (unsure why, but it appears the original used lf95 to compile). Test file: 0.875 s for new executable versus 0.48 s for original executable.
-Updated makefile for gfortran and Windows.
-.bat file for compiling with mingw32.
-data.dat appears to need an empty line at the end for successful parsing.
-rg33opt.exe same as rg33.exe?

##

A makefile is included as an example for running on linux. It will, most likely,
need to be edited.  

A data file is also included to use as a template.  

Note that there are two header files and two main program files.  The header 
files only differ in that one will write that it was run on a PC and the other
says it was run on linux.  The main program files differ in that the one that 
is called main_win will only read from a file called "data.dat" whereas the 
one called main will read from standard input.  Usually the executable 
produced when compiling with the one called main is run from command line 
using redirection, like this:

                   rg33.exe < data1000

If you compile all the .f90 files together without specifying one main 
program and one header file, you will get an error message.
