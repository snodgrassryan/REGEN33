A makefile is included as an example for running on linux. It will, most likely,
need to be edited.  

A data file is also included to use as a template.  

Note that there are two header files and two main program files.  The header 
files only differ in that one will write that it was run on a PC and the other
says it was run on linux.  The main program files differ in that the one that 
is called main_win will only read from a file called "data.dat" whereas the 
one called main will read from standard input.  Usually the executable 
produced when compiling with the one called main is run from command line 
using redirection, like this:

                   rg33.exe < data1000

If you compile all the .f90 files together without specifying one main 
program and one header file, you will get an error message.
