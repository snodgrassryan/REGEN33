## Update 1/13/2023 Ryan Snodgrass. Version 3.4.1

-Added printing of Fourier coefficients for mass flow and pressure to the rgwt file. Printed at last cycle. See function FOURIER_COEFF_ALL_X in output_mod.f90 and function fouran in compute_mod.f90. The "a" coefficients in the rgwt file are sine and the "b" coefficients are cosine.
-Added mass flow phase and pressure phase relative to pressure at the right end, as a function of x. This is printed in the rgwt file for the last cycle. These changes are in output_mod.f90. Phase is calculated using the maximum of the waveforms.
-After compiling with gfortran using -O3 (high runtime optimization) the rg33 executable is smaller in size and may be slower than the original REGEN3.3 executable. Test file: 0.875 s for new executable versus 0.48 s for original executable. However, for a file with many more time steps and x mesh points, run time seems to be the same as REGEN3.3 (~ 16 minutes for both compiled executables).
-rgwt files parsed and plotted using Python. rgwt plotter not updated or tested.
-Updated makefile for gfortran and Windows.
-.bat file for compiling with mingw32.
-data.dat appears to need an empty line at the end for successful parsing.
-rg33opt.exe same as rg33.exe. Other .exes have not been updated.

##



A makefile is included as an example for running on linux. It will, most likely,
need to be edited.  

A data file is also included to use as a template.  

Note that there are two header files and two main program files.  The header 
files only differ in that one will write that it was run on a PC and the other
says it was run on linux.  The main program files differ in that the one that 
is called main_win will only read from a file called "data.dat" whereas the 
one called main will read from standard input.  Usually the executable 
produced when compiling with the one called main is run from command line 
using redirection, like this:

                   rg33.exe < data1000

If you compile all the .f90 files together without specifying one main 
program and one header file, you will get an error message.
